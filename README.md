Groundwater values Ra-226, Ra-228, K-40 were estimated for an area
in Atiwa.
Sampled values were used to interpolate the whole Atiwa District with 
IDW with nearest neighbour searching,
A single paletted symbology was applied to get a graduated colour scale.
In the end a spatial distribution map was composed in QGIS to compare the concentration levels 
for the three concentration levels : Ra-226(bq/l), Ra-228(bq/l) and K-40 ((bq/l).
Separate spatial distribution maps were generated for concentration levels
Boxplots of observations were plotted 
A normal distribution of concentration levels was generated

3d distribution of area was plotted with R
